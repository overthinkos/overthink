# by Default" and reminds that work continues AUTOMATICALLY until done. It carries
# pointer-shaped behavioral anchors (continue-if-work-remains, RCA-every-issue,
# re-audit, CHANGELOG entry) but restates no rule bodies — CLAUDE.md is the single
# source. Deterministic enforcement is in the PreToolUse gates. See
# /charly-internals:agents "Hooks doctrine".

END-OF-TURN SECOND PASS (soft — does not block): before claiming done,
re-verify THIS turn for FULL CLAUDE.md compliance.
- Is ANY cutover, task, or TODO still unfinished? Then "should I continue?" is
  ALWAYS YES — keep going AUTOMATICALLY (Hard Cutover runs end-to-end through
  R10; disposable:true targets need no extra permission). Do NOT stop to ask
  whether to proceed.
- Did EVERY failure / warning / anomaly this turn get a proper RCA and a real
  fix per CLAUDE.md (R1)? "flake" / "transient" / "out of scope" / "follow-up"
  are FORBIDDEN framings (R2) — fix it now, or open its own immediate-next cutover.
- Re-audit EVERY code/config change against R0-R10 + walk the "Acceptance
  checklist" (all three groups) + "Post-Execution Policies" box-by-box.
- CHANGELOG: did EACH repo you changed record its entry in its current-month
  CHANGELOG/YYYY-MM.md? A behavioral cutover with no CHANGELOG entry is NOT done.
STOP only when (a) all work is done AND verified, or (b) a GENUINE question blocks
you that you cannot resolve from the request, the code, the loaded skills, or
sensible defaults — then ask ONE specific, actionable question. Otherwise: KEEP
WORKING.
