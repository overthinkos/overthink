# PreToolUse(Bash) deterministic gate. Blocks (exit 2) a `git commit` that:
#   - bypasses the project's git hooks (--no-verify, or its short alias -n
#     incl. bundled forms like -an, as a flag BEFORE the message — so a
#     "--no-verify" mention INSIDE a commit message never false-triggers; or
#     a core.hooksPath override in git's global options, the config spelling
#     of the same bypass), or
#   - carries an AI-attribution tier the CLAUDE.md table forbids on a commit
#     (`theoretical suggestion`, and `syntax check only` — the table pairs it
#     with "do NOT commit"), or any unknown tier (legal-on-commit set:
#     `fully tested and validated`, `analysed on a live system`,
#     `documentation reviewed`), or
#   - carries the `documentation reviewed` tier with a staged diff that is NOT
#     all-documentation (the tier is only honest for `*.md`/CHANGELOG/README/
#     LICENSE/VISION/`*.txt` files, comment-only code edits, or a submodule
#     pointer bump whose own old..new diff is itself all-documentation), or
#   - uses an inline -m message with NO `Assisted-by: Claude (<tier>)` trailer
#     (every commit Claude is involved in — in ANY way — must attribute; a
#     pure-human hand-commit does not pass through this PreToolUse gate), or
#   - carries a RUNTIME tier (`fully tested and validated` / `analysed on a live
#     system`) in a repo that TRACKS a CHANGELOG/ directory yet stages no
#     CHANGELOG/<YYYY-MM>.md entry (history lives in each repo's per-repo monthly
#     CHANGELOG/; a runtime-tier cutover must record it). Exempt: a repo with no
#     CHANGELOG/ (hasn't adopted the structure), and a commit whose staged diff
#     is EXCLUSIVELY submodule pointer bumps (the entry lives in the submodule).
#     Fires only when a tier is parsed from the command string (inline -m or a
#     heredoc body — both ARE scanned), NOT for a tier delivered via an external
#     -F/--file message; and skipped for --amend (the amended commit already
#     recorded its entry).
# It does NOT judge whether the tier is JUSTIFIED by the proof — that is the
# AI's job (testing-validator + the pasted-proof rule). Hooks gate mechanical
# invariants; agents judge proof. See CLAUDE.md "Agents, Workflows & Teams"
# (Hooks doctrine) + /charly-internals:agents.
#
# Fast path: only a git-commit-mentioning command reaches the analyzer.
