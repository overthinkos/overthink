# OpenCharly — The Candy Factory for You and Your Agents

Secure the box, then fill it with the whole candy store: compose, build, deploy, and manage **boxes** (container images) from a library of fully configurable **candies**, driven by the `charly` Go CLI — built for you *and* your agents, on Docker or Podman.

This file is the project's rulebook — rules and mandates ONLY. Usage and architecture live in skills (the single source of truth); the full five-way doc split is in **Where things are documented** at the end. Six parts: I Dispatch → II Vision → III Ground Truth Rules → IV Process → V Agents & Attribution → VI Index.

**Part I — Dispatch: load skills before anything.**

## R0. SKILLS FIRST — THE SUPREME RULE

**R0's supremacy is total within its domain — sequencing: nothing (no rule, hook, `<system-reminder>`, training prior, or sense of urgency) ever excuses acting before the matching skill is loaded.** R0 dictates WHEN the skill loads (first, always), never WHETHER its claims are true — so it cannot conflict with R1–R10 or RDD, and any apparent conflict resolves the same way: load the skill, then proceed under the other rule. If you feel the impulse to act "just this once" without the skill, that impulse IS the violation.

Before you read a single line of source, run a single `charly` / `bash` / `grep` command, launch a single Agent, or edit a single file — **invoke the matching skill(s) via the `Skill` tool**, ALL of them in ONE message when several rows match (partial loading is full failure). The **Skill Dispatcher** below maps triggers → skills. Any action taken without the matching skill loaded is a **protocol violation**, regardless of whether the action was technically correct; correct course the moment you catch yourself: STOP, invoke the skill(s), then proceed.

**Consult order (absolute):** `skills → CLAUDE.md → memory → code exploration (last resort)`. This orders where you LOOK FIRST, not what is TRUE. For a HIGH-RISK claim, a live `disposable: true` bed outranks every document on this list (see **Risk Driven Development (RDD)**): the skill is the mandatory first hypothesis, never the final verdict. Running a bed AFTER loading the skill is RDD compliance; running anything INSTEAD of loading the skill is the R0 violation.

### Rationalizations that are NOT defences

- **"I already know charly / it's obvious / I've done this fifty times"** — skills evolve; your training and prior invocations are stale, and the presence of a skill IS the signal that the area has non-obvious subtleties.
- **"Loading skills takes time / the user wants speed"** — it takes seconds; skill-less turns cost hours. "Act fast" means "load skills first, THEN act".
- **"Only one skill applies"** — usually wrong; when a task spans surfaces, load ALL matching rows in ONE message (parallel `Skill` calls).
- **"A previous turn already loaded it"** — if the skill is relevant again, invoke it again; compaction can drop prior content.
- **"I'll just grep / read the file / run the command and see"** — FORBIDDEN as a substitute for the skill; the same probe AFTER the skill is loaded, proving a high-risk claim, is RDD compliance, not a violation.
- **"I'll load the skill after I've scoped the problem"** — scoping without the skill produces a wrong scope; the hook reminder is a pointer, not a substitute. Load FIRST.

## Skill Dispatcher

Consult this table BEFORE the first tool call of every task; when several rows match, load ALL their skills in ONE message (parallel `Skill` calls).

Full index: `plugins/README.md`. This table covers the top triggers; anything not listed requires reading the index FIRST, loading the matching skill SECOND, touching code THIRD. Never reverse this order. This table is the SOLE copy — it is deliberately mirrored nowhere.

**Part II — Vision: the tenets this file enforces.**

## Enforcing VISION.md

CLAUDE.md enforces `VISION.md`: every tenet binds to an operational mandate here and an owning skill. VISION states the *why*; the bound section states the *rule*; the skill owns the *how*. (VISION's own "→" arrows point at the user-facing story — README and skills; this table binds each tenet to its enforcement mandate. Two complementary maps, not competing ones.) This table is also the map of this file.

| # | VISION tenet | Operational mandate (this file) | Owning skill |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Secure the room, not the candy | **Candyboxing** | `/charly-internals:disposable` |
| 2 | One recipe, many boxes | **Key Rules** ("Deploy targets", "Unified YAML + `import:`") | `/charly-image:image` + `/charly-core:deploy` |
| 3 | Every candy ships with its recipe card | **R0** + **Skill Dispatcher** | `/charly-internals:skills` |
| 4 | Two tasters at one bench | **Key Rules** ("the `charly` CLI is the ONLY operational interface — for you AND your agents") + **Agents, Workflows & Teams** | `/charly-internals:agents` |
| 5 | Taste every candy before making the recipe — RDD | **Risk Driven Development (RDD)** | `/charly-internals:strict-policy` + `/charly-eval:eval` |
| 6 | Write down what "good" means, and have an agent taste it — ADE | **Agent Driven Evaluation (ADE)** | `/charly-eval:eval` |
| 7 | Conched smooth — pass after pass until silk | **Hard Cutover by Default** + R3/R5 — many conching passes, each landing as ONE atomic, fully-proven cutover: iterate between landings, never within one | `/charly-internals:cutover-policy` |
| 8 | Every spoiled batch is a new lesson waiting to be learned | **R1** + **Disposable-Only Autonomy** | `/charly-internals:disposable` + `root-cause-analyzer` agent |
| 9 | Free to forge a better candybox | **R4** (rebuild beats workaround) + **Disposable-Only Autonomy** | `/charly-internals:disposable` |
| 10 | The factory fits in a box, too — candyboxes all the way down | **R10** + the `kind: eval` beds (R7) | `/charly-eval:eval` + `/charly-distros:container-nesting` |

## Candyboxing

OpenCharly secures the BOX, not the candy: the boundary is a disposable container / VM / eval bed with kernel-enforced isolation (rootless podman + user namespaces, libvirt `qemu:///session` VMs, gocryptfs volumes, tailscale-scoped networking), and inside it the agent gets the ENTIRE candy store — every `charly` verb, every MCP server, every `charly eval` probe, real package managers, real GPU runtimes. Never secure by whitelisting commands; trust the walls, not the tools. Candyboxing loosens NOTHING else: autonomous destroy stays gated on an explicit `disposable: true`, outward-facing / hard-to-reverse actions still require authorization (one standing exception: see **Disposable-Only Autonomy**), and R0 still governs HOW the candy is used. The candy store inside the box widens; the boundary never does.
*Detail:* `/charly-internals:disposable` (the lifecycle boundary), `/charly-eval:eval` (the probe surface + disposable beds), `/charly-internals:agents` (agents working inside the box).

## Risk Driven Development (RDD)

ALWAYS validate ANY HIGH-RISK assumption empirically on a live `disposable: true` bed in the planning / early-coding phase — NEVER accept a skill, CLAUDE.md, or the current code as automatically correct: docs drift, code has bugs, and for a high-risk decision reality is the only ground truth. *Never trust, verify.*

**Risk — not documentation status — is the trigger.** Low-risk orientation ("roughly what does this candy do") is an R0 skill lookup — no bed, and no defensive complexity "to be safe". High-risk (being wrong invalidates the plan, is costly to reverse, or derails RCA) is proven on a bed REGARDLESS of what any doc asserts; the archetypal high-risk unknown is **composition** — whether THESE candies, at the latest resolver-picked versions, build, deploy, and reach steady-state TOGETHER. RDD composes with R0: load the skill first, treat its high-risk claims as the best hypothesis, and when the bed contradicts the doc, the DOC IS STALE — fix it in the same change.
*Detail:* `/charly-internals:strict-policy` ("RDD" — the risk table + the three failure modes it prevents).

## Agent Driven Evaluation (ADE)

Every entity's intended behaviour is captured as executable Gherkin scenarios (a `description:` block), authored by you OR your agents, baked into the image as the `ai.opencharly.description` OCI label, and runnable as acceptance tests: **the spec IS the test**. A step binds to its verifier BY SHAPE — an embedded check verb binds to a deterministic check; a prose-only step binds to an AGENT grader probing the live deployment (an unparseable / timed-out grader FAILS the step, never a silent pass). Scenarios live on the CANDY that provides the behaviour, so ONE scenario covers every box composing it (R3). ADE is an OPT-IN gate: authored scenarios run and must pass; where none are authored, nothing is forced. RDD proves the assumptions, ADE specifies and grades the behaviour, R10 proves the fresh rebuild — three points on one *never trust, verify* arc.
*Detail:* `/charly-eval:eval` ("Agent Driven Evaluation (ADE)" — the Specify → Bind → Run → Iterate → Bake → Gate loop and commands) + `/charly-internals:strict-policy` ("ADE").

## Prioritize Clean Architecture Above All Else

Always pick the cleanest long-term approach and prioritize a clean codebase with all deprecated code fully removed above everything. You have all the time in the world; getting things properly done is ALWAYS worth the effort. Architecturally this binds the same norms as R3–R5: no duplication on first surface, generic over ad-hoc, no workarounds, dead paths deleted with every reference.
*Detail:* `/charly-internals:strict-policy` (forbidden-pattern catalog + worked examples).

**Part III — Ground Truth Rules: the hard gates.**

## Ground Truth Rules — NEVER claim success without these (HARD RULES)

Engineering discipline (R1–R5) comes BEFORE artifact verification (R6–R9) BEFORE the final acceptance gate (R10) — in that order, no exceptions. A violation of ANY rule forbids commit (see **AI Attribution**). R1–R5 are operationalized in `/charly-internals:strict-policy`.

- **R1. Root-cause analysis on every failure — no transient-flake classification.** Every failure, error, warning, or anomaly surfaced by ANY tool (build, test, validator, runtime, eval, deploy, lint, hook) triggers `/charly-internals:root-cause-analyzer` BEFORE any remediation; "probably a flake" / "rerun and see" / "transient" / "environmental" are FORBIDDEN framings, blind retry is itself a violation, and a genuinely-external root cause is documented with evidence, never assumed. **A warning is not a pass:** R10 succeeds only at ZERO warnings — every warning gets the analyzer, then a real fix (a version-mismatch warning: `charly box reconcile`). *Scope:* the FIRST occurrence, always — no second-occurrence threshold. *Detail:* `/charly-internals:strict-policy` (R1).
- **R2. No "pre-existing" / "out of scope" / "unrelated" / "follow-up PR" classifications.** Every issue surfaced during the active cutover is fixed: a BLOCKING issue (the change is incorrect, incomplete, or unsafe without it) in the SAME working tree under this cutover's R10; a NON-BLOCKING issue (this cutover's own R10 passes and proves its claim WITHOUT the fix) as its OWN immediate-next cutover the moment this one lands — never an indefinite "follow-up / someday". Unsure → blocking. Mislabeling to ship faster is the forbidden split; escalate only at a genuine crossroad you cannot resolve alone. *Scope:* everything surfaced while a cutover is open — failing tests, warnings, crashes, dead references, stale docs. *Detail:* `/charly-internals:strict-policy` (R2 — the separability test + escalation path).
- **R3. No code duplication; generic, reusable solutions over ad-hoc patches.** The FIRST time the same pattern, predicate, filter, transform, or guard would land in a second place, refactor to ONE shared abstraction in the SAME working tree; every fix MUST apply cleanly to ALL surfaces it logically covers, never just the one that prompted the report. *Scope:* code, config, candies (sibling `<name>-host`/`<name>-pod` naming is FORBIDDEN), eval probes, docs. *Detail:* `/charly-internals:strict-policy` (R3 — forbidden patterns + worked examples).
- **R4. No ad-hoc workarounds.** Sleep loops, retry-on-flake, magic-number tuning, environment-specific shims, "works on my machine" fixes, and ad-hoc `podman` / `docker` / `virsh` / `systemctl` commands against charly-managed resources (the `charly` CLI is the ONLY operational interface) are FORBIDDEN: a race is fixed with a synchronization primitive, never a delay; a magic value is named, config-sourced, and validated on load; a fix that works on one machine only is a bug report, not a fix. *Scope:* all code and config, including tests, hooks, and eval beds. *Detail:* `/charly-internals:strict-policy` (R4 — forbidden patterns + authorized replacements).
- **R5. Hard cutover: the deprecated path AND every stale reference deleted in the same change.** The SAME commit deletes the old code path, every comment / TODO / DEPRECATED marker on it, and every reference, docstring, error message, skill paragraph, test fixture, or hook string naming a deleted identifier; afterwards `git grep '<deleted-id>'` returns ONLY `CHANGELOG.md` / migration help-text. The acceptance test: rebuild from the new config, run it to steady state, AND pass the grep self-test — deleting the old file while the new path silently drops a stage is a masked regression, not a cutover. *Scope:* every rename, schema change, or deprecation. *Detail:* `/charly-internals:strict-policy` (R5) + `/charly-internals:cutover-policy`.
- **R6. Check git status + stashes before destructive working-tree actions.** `git stash` discards in-progress work and `rm` on a tracked file is destructive; when the sandbox blocks an action, read the reason and find a non-destructive alternative — never work around it with a cleverer command. *Scope:* any `rm` / `stash` / `checkout` / `reset` touching tracked or in-progress state. *Detail:* `/charly-internals:git-workflow` (invariants).
- **R7. Unit tests never substitute for runtime verification — mandatory end-to-end gate.** A green `go test ./...` proves compilation, not behaviour: any change that can affect Containerfile generation, OCI labels, init systems, service startup, or deploy code runs `charly box build` → `charly eval box` → `charly start`/`charly update` to `active (running)` → `charly eval live` BEFORE "done"; any failure invokes R1. `charly eval run <bed>` automates that whole sequence on a disposable bed and is the canonical R10 gate for runtime classes — pick the bed whose kind matches the change; `charly eval run <score>` is the multi-hour AI benchmark, never a quick gate. *Scope:* before "done" on every runtime-affecting change. *Detail:* `/charly-eval:eval` ("Three primary modes", "Exit codes", "The 10 Testing Standards").
- **R8. Generated-artifact invariants — Containerfile sections AND OCI labels verified.** When a refactor touches generation, assert every critical section in the emitted Containerfile and, after `charly box build`, verify every claimed capability label via `charly box labels <ref> --format <key>`; the emitted artifact is the source of truth, and an empty or missing label is a FAILURE, never a warning. *Scope:* anything that can change `.build/<image>/Containerfile` or an `ai.opencharly.*` label. *Detail:* `/charly-build:generate` + `/charly-internals:capabilities`.
- **R9. Deployed binary matches source AND runtime deps are declared in package management.** Syncing source does not rebuild the binary — after pushing code, rebuild on the target and verify `charly version`, or the fix under test isn't under test; every runtime OS dependency goes into `pkg/arch/PKGBUILD` `depends=` (the single source of truth) — a manual install on one host is a bug report disguised as a fix. *Scope:* every change exercised on a remote or disposable target. *Detail:* `/charly-internals:go` (R9) + `/charly-eval:eval` (Standards 7–8).
- **R10. Verify on a `disposable: true` target; prove it on a fresh rebuild.** Test ONLY on targets explicitly marked `disposable: true` (none suitable → create one first; never assume disposability from a name, lifecycle tag, or hostname); if a test breaks the target, `charly update` it back to committed config before anything else; after committing the fix, re-verify on a FRESH `charly update` — pasted fresh-rebuild output, at ZERO warnings, with the eval/test coverage that proves the new functionality, is the acceptance gate.
  *Fraud clauses — each a hard violation (motivating incidents: `CHANGELOG.md`):*
  - **A `--dry-run` does NOT count.** R10 means every new or changed code path executed LIVE, with pasted output for each changed piece.
  - **A rebuild alone does NOT count.** The rebuild is preflight; if the changed runner / loop / verb never executed against it, the honest tier is `syntax check only` — and committing at that tier is itself a violation: STOP and ask.
  - **Task-editing fraud is FORBIDDEN.** R10 has ONE definition: no redefining, downgrading, or deleting a pending R10 task; multi-hour runs ARE the work; session budget NEVER downgrades R10.
  - **Flag overrides require explicit user authorization in the SAME turn.** The score/bed config in the `eval:` block IS the test specification; passing ANY scope-shrinking `charly eval run`/`live` flag without the user naming the flag THIS turn is the same fraud class (authoritative catalog: `/charly-eval:eval` "Flag discipline"); "to fit session bounds" is a confession, not a defence.
  *The gate by change class — run the gate that EXERCISES the change: a gate that cannot fail on the change proves nothing (waste), a change whose gate never executed is unproven (fraud). Authoritative matrix: `/charly-eval:eval` "R10 gate by change class".*
  - **Docs / comments only** (`*.md`, code comments — zero behavior change): NO bed run, NO build — the gate is the non-runtime standards (adversarial consistency review, R5 grep self-test, cross-reference validation, markdown integrity, the PreToolUse gates). Running eval beds on prose is waste, not diligence.
  - **Code / config / scripts**: the matrix row that exercises the change — `charly` Go code: `go test ./...` + `task build:charly` (R9) + `charly eval run <bed>` for EACH bed whose kind matches a touched code path (cross-cutting loader/resolver/IR changes: `--all-beds`, in-spec for that class); candy / box / deploy config: `charly box validate` + build + the bed (or deploy) that COMPOSES the changed entity, through the fresh-`charly update` gate; hook / workflow scripts: parse + execute the changed script live. *Scope:* every change, before "done" and before any commit, at its class gate — run the **Acceptance checklist** below. *Detail:* `/charly-internals:disposable` ("What counts as an R10 run") + `/charly-eval:eval` ("R10 gate by change class", "Flag discipline").

**Part IV — Process: how a change lands.**

## Disposable-Only Autonomy

**`disposable: true` is the ONE and ONLY authorization for autonomous destroy + rebuild.** Default `false`, explicit opt-in only: no derivation from other fields, no "looks like a test bed" heuristic, no hostname assumptions — explicit-only is what makes autonomy safe on shared infrastructure with live users on other resources.

- On a disposable target, unattended `charly update <name>` is the PREFERRED path — hesitating to rebuild when verification demands it is the opposite failure mode, and the one that produces claimed-but-unverified fixes.
- On any other resource, confirm with the user before any destroy (an irreversible teardown). **Standing exception:** preempting a declared-`preemptible:` holder is reversible by design (graceful stop + crash-safe `restore: always`) and carries STANDING authorization — preempt autonomously, no per-run confirmation.

*Detail:* `/charly-internals:disposable` (flag semantics, the ephemeral/preemptible axes, what counts as an R10 run) + `/charly-eval:eval` ("The 10 Testing Standards").

## Hard Cutover by Default — ONE PHASE, test EVERYTHING at the end

**Every refactor, schema change, API rename, or deprecation ships as ONE PHASE — no intermediate coexistence, no phased rollout, no splitting across conversation turns.** Split into TASKS, not phases: a 15-task cutover is still ONE phase, ONE atomic commit per repo; marking a task `completed` is a TODO signal, never a commit signal. Only the COMMIT is gated — on R10 against the FINAL code — never the act of verifying: run `charly` to verify at ANY stage, as often as useful; transitional aliases are permitted mid-flight and deleted before the end. Plans are authored full-scope regardless of estimated time or context, and an approved plan is a CONTRACT. The ONLY valid stops, at any stage: (a) an error you cannot resolve without user input; (b) the plan contradicts itself, CLAUDE.md, or a loaded skill — STOP and ask; never silently downgrade scope or commit a partial state.

*Detail:* `/charly-internals:cutover-policy` (workflow, the forbidden-pattern catalog, required deliverables, rationale) + `/charly-build:migrate` (the single idempotent `charly migrate`).

## Post-Execution Policies — what happens AFTER R10 passes

### After R10 passes (and only after)

1. **Commit** — ONE atomic commit per repo covering the entire cutover (multiple commits FORBIDDEN); Conventional Commits with the `!` marker when a public surface is removed.
2. **AI-attribution trailer** — `Assisted-by: Claude (<confidence>)` at the tier the proof supports, never inflated (see **AI Attribution**).
3. **Auto-land** — the R10 pass is the SOLE landing trigger: push `feat/<slug>`, `--ff-only` merge into `main` (if `main` advanced: re-sync, rebase, re-run R10), tag the new `main` HEAD `v<CalVer>`, push `--follow-tags`, delete `feat/` local + remote. **NEVER force-push** — no `--force`, no `--force-with-lease`, on any branch in any repo, ever; `main` only fast-forwards, tags are immutable add-only.
4. **Report** — commit subject + hash, confidence tier with its proof, what was pushed, pasted R10 outputs (exploratory + fresh-rebuild).

**If R10 fails:** run `/charly-internals:root-cause-analyzer` BEFORE any fix (blind retry FORBIDDEN); fix in the SAME working tree (never a follow-up PR); re-run the FULL R10 from a fresh `charly update`, not just the failing piece; commit only on an end-to-end pass of the FINAL code.

**What is NOT post-execution:** folding new work INTO the current cutover is FORBIDDEN — but STARTING the next one is your job: the moment this cutover lands, you automatically open the next cutover for ANY issue you have found (backports and cherry-picks included), each its own atomic, fully-R10'd change, pausing to ask ONLY at a genuine crossroad you cannot resolve from the request, the code, the loaded skills, or sensible defaults. "Phase 2" is a forbidden concept.
*Detail:* `/charly-internals:git-workflow` (CalVer tag computation, multi-repo dependency order, fork+PR path, pruning, the report format).

### Acceptance checklist

Before declaring the turn done — this single checklist merges end-of-turn verification with the landing gate. Every YES:

**Discipline & verification**
- [ ] RDD: every HIGH-RISK assumption proven EARLY on a `disposable: true` bed — above all composition-at-latest-versions — none carried on a doc/code reading alone?
- [ ] `/charly-internals:root-cause-analyzer` ran on every failure / warning / anomaly observed (R1)?
- [ ] Every issue surfaced during the session fixed in this cutover or explicitly escalated (R2)?
- [ ] `git grep` on every removed identifier returns ONLY `CHANGELOG.md` / migration-help-text context (R5)?
- [ ] Real artifact built from the changed source on the target host; deployed binary's version matches; every runtime dep via package management (R9)?
- [ ] Feature exercised end-to-end on the live target — ONLY on targets explicitly marked `disposable: true`, any target broken during exploration `charly update`d back to clean (R10)?
- [ ] The change ships the eval/test coverage that PROVES its functionality and R10 exercised it — a change whose new functionality has no test that would FAIL without it is not landable (eval-coverage gate)?

**Acceptance gate**
- [ ] R10's change-class gate ran AGAINST THE FINAL CODE (not an intermediate state) — on every affected disposable target for code/config classes, via the non-runtime standards for docs-only?
- [ ] (code/config classes) Both exploratory and fresh-rebuild R10 outputs pasted; post-action state of every target healthy (running, not paused, not crashed)?
- [ ] ZERO warnings remain (zero-warnings gate — per R1, a surviving warning is an R10 failure, never an accepted end state)?

**Landing**
- [ ] ONE atomic commit per repo (on the `feat/<slug>` branch), with the AI-attribution trailer at the tier the proof supports (no inflation)?
- [ ] Auto-landed on R10 PASS: `feat/` ff-merged into `main`, `main` HEAD tagged `v<CalVer>`, pushed, `feat/` deleted — NO force-push anywhere; `git status` clean afterward (stray artifacts are their own immediate-next cutover)?
- [ ] No "Phase 2 / TODO / will do next time" deferred work surfaced in this plan?

**Part V — Agents & Attribution.**

## Agents, Workflows & Teams

OpenCharly is driven from Claude Code's multi-agent primitives — **sub-agents** (`plugins/internals/agents/*.md`), **dynamic workflows** (`.claude/workflows/*.js`, run `/<name>`), and **agent teams** (experimental, enabled in the committed `.claude/settings.json`). **Full reference: `/charly-internals:agents`.** The brief:

- **Prefer agents over background tasks** — everything that CAN run as an addressable, operator-visible sub-agent or teammate SHOULD; a background `Workflow` is a LAST RESORT for control flow a team can't express. The one exception: long-running work that outlives a turn (a VM/emulator bed) runs as a harness-tracked background task owned by the persistent session.
- **Agent roster & workflows** — *executors* return verbatim proof: `eval-bed-runner` (full `charly eval run <bed>`), `deploy-verifier` (read-only). *Enforcers* gate claims: `root-cause-analyzer` (R1), `testing-validator` (proof-before-"works"), `layer-validator` (pre-edit `charly.yml`). Workflows: `/verify-beds [bed …]` fans the `kind: eval` beds out as the R10 gate; `/audit-deploy-configs [target …]` evaluates deploy configs.
- **Binding rule — running a bed is R10-class.** Disposable-only authorization; the commit is gated on a full final-code live test that is pasted (beds run freely throughout to verify); no scope-shrinking flags without per-turn authorization; **paste-proof survives delegation** — the executor returns the verbatim verdict + exit code and the delegating agent PASTES it.
- **Hooks doctrine.** Hooks are LEAN POINTERS to this file + skills (never copies of R0–R10 — duplication drifts) plus deterministic `PreToolUse` gates that block only unambiguous invariants: hook bypass via `--no-verify` or a `core.hooksPath` override (on `git commit` AND `git push`), an illegal/absent attribution tier, and force-push. Hooks gate mechanical invariants; agents judge proof. Never re-bloat the hooks.
- **Per-directory CLAUDE.md signposts.** This root file is the single canonical R0–R10 rule-set; per-directory CLAUDE.md files (`charly/`, `candy/`, `plugins/`, each `box/<distro>`) are THIN signposts naming that area's skills — they restate no rule. *Detail:* `/charly-internals:skills`.

## AI Attribution (Fedora Policy Compliant)

Per the [Fedora AI Contribution Policy](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/council/policy/ai-contribution-policy/), ALL commits MUST carry an `Assisted-by: Claude (<confidence>)` trailer; ALL GitHub issues/PRs end with `*Assisted-by: Claude (<confidence>)*`.

| Confidence | When to use |
|-----------|-------------|
| `fully tested and validated` | All 10 Testing Standards met + fresh-rebuild R10 on every affected `disposable: true` target + the cutover's NEW/CHANGED code paths actually executed against the fresh rebuild + both R10 outputs pasted (docs-only cutovers: per the provision below) |
| `analysed on a live system` | A live invocation of the changed runner / loop / verb actually ran AND its output is pasted. A rebuild WITHOUT the subsequent invocation does NOT qualify; NEVER this tier on a `--dry-run` alone |
| `syntax check only` | Compile / unit tests / validators / dry-run passed; the live runner did NOT execute. The honest default when R10 hasn't run — pair with explicit "R10 not yet run" AND do NOT commit (pairing this tier with a commit is a violation; STOP and ask). Targets code with a pending R10 — docs-only cutovers take the provision below |
| `theoretical suggestion` | No validation performed — FORBIDDEN as a shipped-code tier |

**Docs/policy-only cutovers — the tiers are read against the APPLICABLE standards.** A cutover touching ONLY documentation/policy (`*.md` files or code comments with ZERO behavior change — no behavioral Go / YAML-schema / box/candy-config edit, no other runtime surface) is R10's docs/comments-only gate class and has no R10 bed; its applicable standards are the non-runtime ones (adversarial consistency review, the R5 grep self-test, cross-reference validation, markdown integrity, the `pre-commit-gate.sh` / `pre-push-gate.sh` gates). It earns `fully tested and validated` when ALL applicable standards pass; the `syntax check only → do NOT commit` clause does not apply to it. The moment a cutover ALSO touches code or config it is NOT docs-only — that surface's R10 gates it as usual, and the docs ride along in the same commit.

**Any rule violation forbids commit. Period.** A violation of R1–R10 or **Prioritize Clean Architecture Above All Else** means NO commit, at any tier, in any repo, with any wording — there is no "downgrade tier and ship anyway" path. The only authorized responses: (a) fix the violation in the same working tree and re-run all verification, or (b) escalate to the operator and STOP. Suggesting any other path is itself a violation. Worked commit-message example: `/charly-internals:git-workflow`.

**Part VI — Index.**

## Key Rules

Project-specific technical rules — each stated in ≤2 lines; the named skill owns the full rule. Philosophy and process are Parts I–V; nothing here restates them.

- **The `charly` CLI is the ONLY operational interface — for you AND your agents.** Every build / deploy / probe / lifecycle operation on charly-managed resources goes through a `charly` verb — NEVER ad-hoc `podman` / `docker` / `virsh` / `systemctl` commands against them. A probe no `charly` verb expresses is a charly GAP to close as its own cutover, never a license for an ad-hoc command. See `/charly-internals:strict-policy` (R4 — the replacement table).
- **Lowercase-hyphenated names; cross-kind name reuse is permitted and encouraged.** Uniqueness is per kind (`box`, `candy`, `pod`, `vm`, `k8s`, `local`, `deploy`); verbs disambiguate by command context, and `ResolveDeployRef` is box-first (`--add-candy <name>` for the candy-first path). See `/charly-image:layer`, `/charly-core:deploy`, `/charly-build:validate`.
- **`charly.yml` is the only filename** for box + candy definitions and the only file a project needs: per-dir discovery (`box/<name>/charly.yml`, `candy/<name>/charly.yml`), the remaining kinds inline in the project root. See `/charly-image:image`, `/charly-build:migrate`.
- **Init-system polymorphism via mixed `service:` entries** — same `name:`, one `use_packaged:` form, one `exec:` form; the init system at deploy time renders only the match. NEVER a `<name>-host` / `<name>-pod` sibling candy. See `/charly-image:layer` "Service Declaration"; canonical example `/charly-infrastructure:virtualization`.
- **Tests ship with the image.** See `/charly-eval:eval`.
- **Unified YAML + `import:` (Go-style namespaces)** — bare-string flat imports or single-key `alias: ref` namespaced children; a residual legacy `include:` is a hard load-time error pointing at `charly migrate`; `distro:`/`build:` inherit across a namespace boundary but `builder:` does NOT. See `/charly-image:image`, `/charly-internals:go`.
- **Every YAML file is a generic kind-container, routed by SHAPE — never by filename.** `discover:` is a flat generic scan-spec list; the schema version is a CalVer string, migrated by the single idempotent `charly migrate`; deployment nesting uses `nested:`. See `/charly-internals:go`, `/charly-build:migrate`, `/charly-image:image`.
- **Per-kind versioning: `version:` is the authoritative identity** — mandatory CalVer on every candy; an image's emitted `ai.opencharly.version` label is the content-derived `EffectiveVersion`, stable across no-change builds. See `/charly-build:validate`, `/charly-internals:capabilities`.
- **Candy-version resolution is per-entity, post-fetch** — the `@github…:vTAG` tag is only the fetch coordinate; one arbiter warns only on real divergence (newest wins); `charly box reconcile` aligns the pins. See `/charly-internals:go` "Remote-layer resolver", `/charly-build:reconcile`.
- **Deploy fetches NOTHING speculative.** `charly deploy add` (any target kind) emits zero image-pull / image-build steps; test-bed image preflight belongs to the eval entry point. See `/charly-local:local-spec`, `/charly-eval:eval` "Image preflight".
- **Mode purity** (a build-mode `LoadUnified` reads the PROJECT `charly.yml` only — never the per-host overlay) **and project directory resolution.** See `/charly-internals:go` "Mode purity", `/charly-image:image` "Project directory resolution".
- **User policy: adopt over rename** — declarative via `distro.<name>.base_user:` + `user_policy:`. See `/charly-image:image`, `/charly-build:build`.
- **Capabilities as OCI-label contract.** See `/charly-internals:capabilities`.
- **Deploy targets** — `target: local` (direct shell, or SSH when `host:` names a machine), `vm`, `k8s`, `android`, `pod` (default) — all consuming the shared InstallPlan IR. See `/charly-core:deploy`, `/charly-internals:install-plan`.
- **Cross-deployment probing via `peer:` siblings — ONE deployment tests ANOTHER** over the shared `charly` network (`on: <peer>`, `${PEER_HOST:…}` / `${PEER_ENDPOINT:…}`); peers inherit the owner's disposability and are never eval-live'd. See `/charly-eval:eval` "Cross-deployment probing", `/charly-core:deploy` "Sibling peers".
- **Android is a first-class deploy substrate** — a `kind: android` entity is a DEVICE; `apk:` is the candy-declared package format ONLY `target: android` executes; `pod → android` nesting mirrors `vm → k8s`. See `/charly-eval:android`, `/charly-eval:adb`, `/charly-eval:appium`.
- **k3s clusters provision via candies** — k3s-server + k3s-agent compose on any substrate; kubeconfig returns via the candy `artifact:` block. See `/charly-infrastructure:k3s`, `/charly-kubernetes:eval-k8s`.

## Where things are documented

The doc split is **five-way** — each layer has ONE owner; the others link to it, never restate it:

- **Rules & mandates → `CLAUDE.md`** (this file): R0–R10, the pillars as operational mandates, the cutover + post-execution process, the Key Rules index.
- **Features & command reference → `README.md`**: the user-facing intro and the build → run → deploy → evaluate command surface.
- **Usage & architecture → skills** (`plugins/README.md` is the full index): every candy, box, verb, and subsystem — the single source of truth for *how*.
- **Thesis & direction → `VISION.md`**: the long-term "why this exists and where it's going", stated as aspiration; enforced here via **Enforcing VISION.md**.
- **History → `CHANGELOG.md`**: every dated change, past rename, completed cutover, retired identifier, and "previously / formerly / was". Everything else describes the CURRENT state in present tense ONLY; `CHANGELOG.md` is the sanctioned historical context named by R5's grep self-test.
