// Command plugin-cdp is the OUT-OF-TREE charly plugin serving the `cdp`
// Chrome-DevTools-Protocol check verb (a standalone Go module, its own go.mod). It
// probes a live deployment's Chrome over CDP — open/list/close/text/html/url/eval/
// axtree/coords/raw/wait/screenshot/click/type plus the SPA remote-desktop input group
// — speaking the DevTools HTTP (/json) + per-tab CDP WebSocket surface via
// golang.org/x/net/websocket. The host go-builds this binary and serves it
// OUT-OF-PROCESS over go-plugin gRPC via the charly plugin SDK, so the `cdp:` verb
// dispatches through the provider registry exactly like a built-in — with the verb
// keeping its `cdp:` discriminator + every modifier (tab/url/expression/selector/…) on
// charly's core #Op (authoring unchanged). The latest external dep-shed after
// candy/plugin-appium, -adb, -kube, -spice, -mcp, -record; the CDP WebSocket client
// lives HERE now, fully out of charly's core check surface (charly's core no longer keeps
// a CDP client of its own — the former in-core copy was deleted when wl externalized).
//
// The plugin owns NO podman / venue / port-mapping machinery — the host pre-resolves the
// deployment's CDP port 9222 to a host-reachable DevTools base URL (preresolveCdpEndpoint,
// charly/cdp_preresolve.go) and hands it over via the check env, so this module dials a
// plain URL and needs no container inspection at all.
