// Command plugin-dbus is the OUT-OF-TREE charly plugin serving the `dbus`
// live-container check verb (a standalone Go module, its own go.mod). It interacts with
// D-Bus services inside a running deployment — list / call / introspect / notify — driving
// the venue's session bus through gdbus. The host go-builds this binary and serves it
// OUT-OF-PROCESS over go-plugin gRPC via the charly plugin SDK, so the `dbus:` verb
// dispatches through the provider registry exactly like a built-in — with the verb keeping
// its `dbus:` discriminator + every modifier (dest/path/method/args/text/description) on
// charly's core #Op (authoring unchanged: `dbus: list`, not `plugin: dbus`).
//
// EXEC-based external verb (the second, after record): unlike the PORT-based external verbs
// (mcp/spice/kube/cdp/vnc — the host pre-resolves a dial endpoint), dbus drives the venue's
// own session bus. The host attaches its live DeployExecutor over the E3b reverse channel
// (invokeVerbProvider, the executorInvoker branch), and this plugin dials back through the
// SDK (sdk.ExecutorFromInvoke) to run gdbus on the venue (RunCapture). The `dbus` driver
// therefore owns NO podman / SSH machinery and NO godbus — it speaks only gdbus over the
// executor reverse channel.
//
// STRUCTURAL externalization, NOT a dep-shed: godbus stays in charly's core for the Secret
// Service / GPG secrets (enc.go / secret_service.go / secrets_gpg.go). The host-side
// best-effort notification (`charly cmd --notify` / `charly tmux cmd`) keeps working via its
// own in-core gdbus path (notify.go) — also gdbus, never this plugin.
