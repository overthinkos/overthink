// Command plugin-deploy-pod is the OUT-OF-TREE charly DEPLOY plugin serving the `pod`
// deploy SUBSTRATE — `target: pod` (the DEFAULT substrate: a deployment run as a
// container image via quadlet/podman). It is the pod-substrate sibling of
// candy/plugin-deploy-vm: charly host-builds it and serves it OUT-OF-PROCESS over
// go-plugin gRPC (LocalTransport), then externalDeployTarget Invokes it (OpExecute)
// with the deployment's InstallPlan VIEWS + a venue descriptor, and the host's executor
// served on the broker.
//
// Unlike deploy:vm (whose plugin WALKS the plan inside the guest), pod bakes its install
// steps INTO the image at BUILD time. The host's pod lifecycle hook
// (pod_deploy_lifecycle.go) builds the overlay container image HOST-SIDE in PrepareVenue
// (the SAME core OCITarget/Generator build engine, in-process — nothing crosses gRPC, just
// like vm builds its disk host-side) and the bed runner / `charly start` then configs +
// starts the container. So there is NO per-step venue walk for pod: this plugin's Invoke
// does NOT call kit.WalkPlans — walking the add_candy steps on the host venue would be
// WRONG (they are already baked into the overlay image host-side). It returns an EMPTY
// DeployReply (no teardown reverse ops — pod teardown is `charly remove` + drop overlay
// images, owned by the host lifecycle hook's PostTeardown), keyed by the deploy name.
//
// The plugin exists to serve deploy:pod out-of-process (the uniform substrate model: pod
// is external like local/vm/android/k8s) and to acknowledge the Invoke; the real work
// (overlay build + container lifecycle) is the host's, exactly as the vm lifecycle hook
// owns the VM build+boot while plugin-deploy-vm owns only the plan walk.
