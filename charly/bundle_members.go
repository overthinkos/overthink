// bundle_members.go — sibling `peer:` member deployments: the ONE shared lifecycle.
//
// A BundleNode's `peer:` map declares companion deployments brought up
// ALONGSIDE it on the shared `charly` network (NOT nested inside it). The canonical
// case is a Chrome driver pod that CDP-probes a web-server subject via a check
// with `on: <peer>` (see check_members.go); members are reachable by
// `${HOST:<name>}` and are never check-live'd themselves.
//
// foldMembers registers each member as a top-level, addressable Bundle entry at
// load time (inheriting the owner's disposability), so a member is brought
// up/torn down by the SAME `charly config`/`charly start`/`charly remove` verbs the deploy
// path already uses — no parallel bring-up logic (R3). bringUpMembers /
// tearDownMembers are the single shared helpers, invoked by BOTH the kind:check
// bed runner (check_bed_run.go) and the operator deploy path
// (bundle_add_cmd.go) — `peer:` works identically for check and deploy from one
// codebase.
