//
//   - `charly check box <image>` — pure-image artifact check (disposable
//     container, build-scope checks only, no host port mapping, no
//     volumes attached).
//   - `charly check live <name>` — full-stack check against a running
//     deployment (pod / vm / host / k8s); runtime variables resolved.
//   - `charly check run <name>` — overloaded by the resolved kind: a
//     kind:check bed runs the full R10 sequence (build → check box →
//     deploy → check live → fresh update → tear down); a kind:score
//     drives an AI through iteration cycles. ONE bed per invocation —
//     run a whole roster concurrently via the /verify-beds workflow
//     (one agent per bed). (Replaces the retired `charly check kind <subkind>`,
//     whose hardcoded per-kind bed table moved into check.yml as
//     kind:check entities.)
//
// The mode is explicit; there is no autodetect or implicit fallback.
//

// `wl` was the LAST live-container verb compiled into charly; after it, ZERO check verbs are

	// libvirt`) is served by the out-of-process candy/plugin-vm verb plugin, nested under
	// `charly check` at runtime via attachNestedCheckPlugins exactly like `kube`/`adb`/`appium`.
