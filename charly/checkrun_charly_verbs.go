// checkrun_charly_verbs.go holds the shared host-side helpers the EXTERNAL
// live-container check verbs (cdp/wl/vnc/dbus/mcp/record/kube/adb/appium/spice/libvirt)
// rely on. Every live-container verb is now served OUT-OF-PROCESS by its plugin
// (candy/plugin-*) and dispatches via invokeVerbProvider (the Invoke envelope) — the
// former compiled-in live-verb subprocess dispatcher + its in-proc method-contract seam
// were DELETED once the externalization orphaned them. The post-run artifact validators
// moved to the SDK (sdk.RunArtifactValidators), the ONE copy every out-of-tree verb
// plugin calls. What remains here is the small host-side surface a marshalled plugin
// cannot compute for itself.

// resolveCheckApk resolves a relative committed-APK path (the external adb / appium plugin's
// install / install-app `apk: ./tests/data/...`) against the AUTHORING candy's
// source tree, so a check resolves its fixture whether the candy is local OR
// fetched via @github (the SAME walk-up the deploy path uses, R3). The check's
// Origin is "candy:<key>" where <key> is the candy MAP KEY (a bare name for a
// local candy, the bare @github ref for a fetched one) — CandyDirs is keyed by
// that same key (candySourceDirs), so the single lookup matches in both cases.
//
// It FAILS HARD (returns an error) on every condition where the fixture cannot
// be anchored — a non-candy origin (the step's Origin was lost upstream), an
// absent CandyDirs entry (the candy scan failed or did not see this candy), or a
// file missing under the candy tree. There is NO fallback and NO silent
// cwd-relative pass-through: a wrong CandyDirs must surface here, not be patched
// over into a misleading downstream "no such file".
