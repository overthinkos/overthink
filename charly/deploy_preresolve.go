// deploy_preresolve.go — the GENERAL per-substrate deploy preresolver hook (F1).
//
// An external (out-of-process) deploy substrate's plugin runs the deployment on a
// venue it cannot hold across the process boundary. For most substrates the generic
// externalDeployTarget hands the plugin the deploy's InstallPlan VIEWS + a venue
// descriptor and the plugin drives the venue via the E3b reverse channel. But some
// substrates need HOST-RESOLVED inputs the InstallPlanView provenance view cannot
// carry (the rich Steps are not on the wire) — e.g. deploy:android needs the live adb
// endpoint (engine inspect on the running pod) + the apk install specs (committed-APK
// paths resolved against the candy source tree) + the google-play creds (host
// credential store). That resolution is substrate-specific AND requires host context,
// so it CANNOT live in the plugin and MUST NOT android-special-case the generic target.
//
// The hook is the seam: each external substrate registers ONE preresolver keyed by its
// word; externalDeployTarget looks it up and, when present, ships its opaque payload in
// DeployVenue.Substrate. The generic target never branches on the substrate — only the
// preresolver body is substrate-specific. GENERAL for all 5: any substrate that needs
// host-resolved venue data registers a preresolver here.

// deployPreresolver resolves the substrate-specific preresolved venue payload for one
// external deploy. It receives the deploy's identity (name/path), the project dir, the
// dispatch-merged node (may be nil on the Update path — the preresolver re-resolves
// from the tree), and the compiled InstallPlans (where the apk: ApkInstallStep entries
// live). It returns the opaque JSON the matching plugin decodes (or nil to ship none).
