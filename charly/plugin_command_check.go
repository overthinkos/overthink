// checkCommandHolder is the Kong grammar holder for the extracted `charly check`
// command tree. Unlike the other dedicated command providers (which return an
// ANONYMOUS holder struct from KongCommand), check needs a NAMED holder for ONE
// reason: the out-of-process NESTED command plugins — `charly check kube/adb`,
// each a NestedCommandProvider with CommandParent()=="check" — must be injected
// into CheckCmd's embedded kong.Plugins AFTER collectExternalCommandPlugins() runs
// in main(). A named type lets main() find this holder in cli.Plugins by a single
// type assertion (attachNestedCheckPlugins) and set Check.Plugins — the exact wiring
// that previously read `cli.Check.Plugins = nestedCmds["check"]` when check was a
// hardcoded CLI field. The same holder pointers built by collectExternalCommandPlugins()
// flow through unchanged, so the post-parse dispatch table still reads the kong-filled
// args out of them.

// checkCommand is the `charly check` command tree extracted into its OWN file as a
// dedicated COMMAND-class provider — the same externalizable dedicated-provider pattern
// (see plugin_command_alias.go for the full rationale). It self-registers via
// registerDedicatedBuiltin, is absent from builtinProviderInstances + the `providers:`
// manifest, and reaches the CLI root through collectCommandPlugins() → kong.Plugins.
// KongCommand() returns a fresh checkCommandHolder (CheckCmd verbatim, with an EMPTY
// nested-plugin embed), so `charly check …` parses and dispatches through CheckCmd's
// compiled-in subcommands + Run handlers exactly as when it was a hardcoded CLI field.
// The nested external check subcommands are attached afterwards in main() via
// attachNestedCheckPlugins; the MCP-server build sites leave them empty (matching the
// prior behaviour, where the MCP modelCLI never set cli.Check.Plugins).

// grammar and mutates it in place; nested is the collectExternalCommandPlugins()
