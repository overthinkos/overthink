// reapOrphansCommand is the `charly reap-orphans` leaf command extracted into its OWN
// file as a dedicated COMMAND-class provider — the same externalizable dedicated-provider
// pattern (see plugin_command_alias.go for the full rationale). It self-registers via
// registerDedicatedBuiltin, is absent from builtinProviderInstances + the `providers:`
// manifest, and reaches the CLI root through collectCommandPlugins() → kong.Plugins.
// KongCommand() returns ReapOrphansCmd verbatim (its Run handler still calls the
// unchanged core machinery — LoadBundleConfig + shelling to `charly bundle del`), so
// `charly reap-orphans` parses and dispatches exactly as when it was a hardcoded CLI
// field. Only the registration LOCATION moved off the CLI struct. The filename uses an
// underscore (reap_orphans) while Reserved() returns the hyphenated CLI word.
