// of a compiled-in DeployTargetProvider (F1 — the substrate-kind-plugin dispatch
// seam). A word listed here has NO in-proc builtin: its grpcProvider registers at
// plugin-load time and ResolveTarget routes target:<word> to externalDeployTarget
// over the E3b reverse channel. Both checkDeployProviderBijection (in-proc XOR
// externalized) and isExternalDeploySubstrate (a substrate kind is external iff
// listed here) consult it — so the two gates can never disagree. GENERAL for all
// 5 — ALL FIVE substrates now externalize; the ONLY substrate-specific piece is each one's
// registered preresolver body (android_deploy_preresolve.go / k8s_deploy_preresolve.go) OR
// lifecycle hook (vm_deploy_lifecycle.go / pod_deploy_lifecycle.go), never a branch in the
// generic dispatch. local needs NEITHER — its plan walk + executor selection are the generic
// externalDeployTarget path (the executor is Shell for host:local, SSH for host:user@machine
// — see ResolveTarget), so the plan VIEWS the host marshals already carry everything the
// candy/plugin-deploy-local plugin needs.
//
// vm is served by candy/plugin-deploy-vm (kit.WalkPlans over the GUEST SSHExecutor). Unlike
// local/android/k8s it owns a real venue LIFECYCLE, so it registers a substrateLifecycle
// (vm_deploy_lifecycle.go): the host-side hook that boots the domain + builds the guest
// SSHExecutor the reverse channel serves, runs the nested pod-in-guest orchestration, and
// owns Start/Stop/Status/Logs/Shell/Rebuild + the ssh-config / charly.yml-entry / ephemeral
// teardown bookkeeping. The deploy WALK is still external; only the venue lifecycle stays
// host-side (the host-owns-the-engine principle).
//
// pod is served by candy/plugin-deploy-pod, but unlike vm its plugin WALKS NOTHING: pod bakes
// its install steps INTO the image at build time, so its substrateLifecycle hook
// (pod_deploy_lifecycle.go) builds the overlay container image HOST-SIDE in PrepareVenue (the
// SAME core OCITarget/Generator engine, in-process — like vm builds its disk host-side) and
// owns the container lifecycle (config/start/remove + the `charly update` rebuild gate). The
// plugin's Invoke is a thin acknowledgment; the build engine stays core.
