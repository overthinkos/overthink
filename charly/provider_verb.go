// CheckVerbProvider is the typed in-process form of a check-verb Provider: it
// runs the assert-mode probe and returns a CheckResult directly (carrying the
// live *Runner, which cannot cross the wire). Every built-in verb implements it;
// `runOne` resolves the verb through providerRegistry and calls RunVerb — the
// switch is gone.
//
// An OUT-OF-PROCESS plugin verb does NOT implement this — it is reached via the
// generic `plugin:` envelope (runPluginVerb → ResolveVerb → the Invoke wire
// form), so runOne only ever deals with in-proc CheckVerbProviders.

// The EXTERNAL-CHARLY-VERBS kube/adb/appium/spice/mcp/record/cdp/vnc/dbus/wl/libvirt are
// live-container verbs served OUT-OF-PROCESS (candy/plugin-*); they are reached via the
// generic `plugin:` Invoke envelope (invokeVerbProvider), NOT a typed in-proc contract —
// their method allowlist + required-modifier checks live in the plugin, and their
// method-name enum is enforced by CUE on core #Op. The former in-proc live-verb seam
// (a compiled-in live verb owning its method contract + the host's subprocess dispatcher)
// was deleted once the externalization orphaned it.

// ProvisionActor is the optional do:act half of a verb provider: it renders the
// shell that performs a state-provision verb's side-effect on the live target
// (ok=false for a verb with no act form — an action verb whose handler already
// acts, or a pure observe verb). Only the state-provision verbs (file/package/
// user/group/kernel-param/mount, plus the runtime live-act path of `service`)
// implement it; runProvisionAct resolves the verb and type-asserts ProvisionActor —
// the per-verb act switch is gone (C1b).

// Reverse() records the LOAD-BEARING reversals (ReverseOpServiceDisable / RestoreEnabled
// / RemoveDropin) a shell string would drop. compileActOp resolves a `plugin:` verb's
// provider and, when it implements this, returns ConstructStep (the typed step flows
// through the SAME ServicePackagedStep.Emit{OCI,Local,VM} + Reverse() as before) instead
// of falling through to a generic OpStep. LowersTo names the step kind (the now-removed
// VerbSpec.LowersTo field's role — package/service were its only users, so the field was
// deleted and the lowering target lives on the provider); ConstructStep builds the step
// from the op's plugin_input. A TypedStepProvider therefore also "acts in build/deploy"
// (opActsInBuildDeploy) even though it is not a ProvisionActor.

// a RenderProvisionScript shell string (ProvisionActor) nor a typed InstallStep
// (TypedStepProvider). emitTasks resolves a `plugin:` verb's provider and, when it is
// NOT a ProvisionActor, renders the fragment via emitPluginFragment → Invoke(OpEmit)
// (placement-agnostic: in-proc for a builtin implementing this interface, over go-plugin
// gRPC for an external grpcProvider). A builtin verb implementing BuildEmitter therefore
// also "acts in build/deploy" (opActsInBuildDeploy) even though it is not a ProvisionActor.
// The EXTERNAL placement of the same plugin is a grpcProvider — the host cannot type-assert
// across the process boundary, so opActsInBuildDeploy recognizes that placement separately.
