// pkg/arch/calver.sh — the same value `pacman -Q opencharly-git` reports). Empty
// for an unstamped build (`go build` / `go test` without the ldflag).
//
// This is the binary's TRUE identity — frozen at build time — as opposed to
// ComputeCalVer() below, which is a wall-clock readout of the current moment.
// `charly version` reports BuildCalVer, never the clock: two different binaries must
// never claim the same version, and a newer build must sort higher so a CalVer
// comparison is a RELIABLE freshness signal (a content checksum tells you
// "different" but never "newer" — useless for deciding which charly to keep).

//     → false. Equal-or-newer is deliberately NOT overwritten: never downgrade a
//     venue charly that is ahead of (or matches) the host.
